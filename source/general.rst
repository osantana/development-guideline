General Guidelines
******************


Simplicity
==========

We appreciate simplicity. Simple does not mean simplistic. It's hard to achieve
simplicity because it demands a lot of thinking about the problems and
solutions.


Pragmatism
==========

We are pragmatic about our choices. We will never adopt a solution without a
strong rationale about the decision.


Quality
=======

Quality vs fast-delivery is not a dilemma. We use agile practices to handle
this kind of situations.

We cut solution scope, make partial delivery with high quality or try to
design an alternative solution that enable an easy refactoring in the future.

In fact we cannot neglect quality but we try hard to deliver on time because
we are a business oriented team.


Craftsmanship
=============

We believe strongly in the `Software Craftsmanship`_ movement and in their
manifesto.

.. epigraph::

   As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional
   software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.
   Through this work we have come to value:

   * Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
   * Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
   * Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of
     professionals
   * Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships
   * That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the
     right to be indispensable.
